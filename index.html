                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    I am a results-driven ethical hacker with a proven track record of finding critical vulnerabilities and providing clear, actionable recommendations. My expertise is broad, covering a wide range of issues including **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control, Information Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and logical flaws**. I specialize in helping organizations of all sizes secure their systems, protect user data, and improve their overall security posture. In addition to individual bug reports, I am also available to conduct a **full security audit** to provide a comprehensive analysis of your application's defenses.

                            <p>A logical flaw was discovered in the user registration process, where the system incorrectly applied username validation rules to the email address field. This resulted in a denial of service for new users, as many common email addresses were rejected, making it impossible to create an account.</p>

This broke the registration process for valid email addresses.</li>

                                        <li>The form will either clear itself or return a generic error about invalid characters or an incorrect length, preventing account creation.</li>
