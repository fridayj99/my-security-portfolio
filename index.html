                        Case Study 1: Resolving a Critical Logical Flaw in a User Registration System

                            <p>I identified a logical flaw in a user registration process that was causing a **denial of service** for new users. The system incorrectly validated email addresses, preventing many legitimate users from creating an account. My report enabled the client to quickly fix the issue, improving user experience and conversion rates.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Technical Details:</p>
                            <p>The account creation form's validation logic was misconfigured, applying strict username rules (max 24 characters, no special symbols) to the email field. This caused valid email addresses to be rejected. I provided a detailed proof-of-concept and recommended a separation of validation logic for email and username fields.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Executive Summary:</p>
                            <p>I uncovered a broken access control vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to sensitive technical drawings and internal documents. This flaw could have led to a significant **disclosure of proprietary business information**. I provided the client with a clear path to remediation to secure their internal files.</p>

                            <p>By manipulating URL parameters, I bypassed the application's access control to view restricted documents. This demonstrated a systemic failure in the application's authorization framework. My report provided an immediate fix and long-term recommendations for a more robust access control model to prevent future IDOR vulnerabilities.</p>

                            <p>I identified an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) on a user profile API endpoint that, when exploited, caused the server to crash with a 500 Internal Server Error. This vulnerability created a **denial of service** risk and indicated a fundamental flaw in the application's error handling and access control logic.</p>

                            <p>When attempting to access another user's profile by changing the ID in the API request, the server failed to return a proper authorization error (403 Forbidden). Instead, it crashed. My report detailed the issue and recommended implementing proper access control checks to prevent unauthorized data access and ensure graceful error handling.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Executive Summary:</p>
                            <p>A simple, non-malicious search query was being misinterpreted as a malicious attack by an overly aggressive security system, leading to a **denial of service for legitimate users**. This bug was causing a poor user experience and potential loss of business. I reported the issue, allowing the company to fine-tune their security rules.</p>

                            <p>I found that inputting a basic HTML payload (e.g., `<h1>XSS</h1>`) into the search bar triggered a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule, causing the user's IP to be permanently blocked. My report highlighted the need to adjust the security rules to be more precise and prevent legitimate user activity from being flagged as malicious.</p>
